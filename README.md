## Getting Started

You can either downloas the zip or clone this project. You'll need the latest version of
git, a working knowledge of Xcode and Swift 3 or 4. You will also need to add your own API key in the Constants file for the application to function properly. Look for the following struct below to input your API key:

```
struct TMDBParameterValues {
        static let ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    }
```
### Prerequisites

You will need Xcode installed on your machine. This iteration of the app uses Xcode 9.3
